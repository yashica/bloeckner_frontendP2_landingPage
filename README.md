# Landing Page Project

This is the second project for the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree.

The given starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project.
By primarily modifying the JavaScript file, the starter project has been converted from a static project to an interactive one:

First, one section has been added to the html file manually by copy and paste, two more sections have been added with JS.
Navigation started as empty UL that has been populated with JS: All sections have been retrieved programatically from the html file and for each section, a new navigation item has been added to the navigation bar.
The event listener added to each navigation item scrolls the page to the top of the respective section.
For each section added programmatically, a navigation item is added to the navigation bar, too.

As an additional task, the program detects which section is near the top of the visible area and adds the class "your-active-class" to this section in order to activate animations defined in the given style.css file for the section marked as active class.
